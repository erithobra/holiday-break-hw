# General Assembly is out for winter break! 

Although General Assembly is out for winter break, it's _best_ y'all keep up those cool new skills you're developing! So, to keep you working towards your goals, we've put together some great material to keep you on top of what we've covered so you don't lose it! (Trust us when we say _it's not like riding a bike_.) Below is a list of _completely_ achievable assignments that we ask you to complete before the start of class on **Monday, January 4th, 2021**.

## 1) 10 Days of JavaScript
[10 Days of JavaScript](https://www.hackerrank.com/domains/tutorials/10-days-of-javascript) is a great way to keep up with building your basic JavaScript skills. 

## 2) Eloquent JavaScript 
[Eloquent JavaScript](https://eloquentjavascript.net/) is _crucial_ resource for any developer who wants to excel at the language. This style of study may feel akin to your old school days, but the material is _easily_ accessible online and even has inline text editors for you to apply the concepts without opening your text editor locally. It's pretty sweet! ðŸš€

#### Complete the following list:
- Read the [Introduction](https://eloquentjavascript.net/00_intro.html)
- Read [Chapter 1](https://eloquentjavascript.net/01_values.html) and complete relevant exercies within. 
- Read [Chapter 2](https://eloquentjavascript.net/02_program_structure.html) and complete relevant exercies within. 
- Read [Chapter 3](https://eloquentjavascript.net/03_functions.html) and complete relevant exercies within. 

## 3) Portfolio page 
The team would love nothing else to but see all your portfolios in full bloom upon your return from break so we ask that you begin your refactor of your previous portfolio page into React.  We'd like you to take as least 5 previous assignments, including labs and hw's to include and demo on your site.

## 4) Computer Science On myGA - (Edits still in process, awaiting myGA access to same materials)

General Assembly has put together _great_ reference material for Computer Science concepts which is available on your [my.generalassemb.ly](https://my.generalassemb.ly/) account.  It includes modules for: 

- Algorithms
- Data Structures
- Design Patterns

ðŸ‘‡ This will _definitely_ change!
Being that you have already been introduced to Link Lists and Stacks/Queues, we'd ask that you watch the entire Data Structures videos series (4.5hrs | 9 lessons).
