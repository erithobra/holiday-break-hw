# General Assembly is out for winter break! 

Although General Assembly is out for winter break, it's _best_ y'all keep up those cool new skills you're developing! So, to keep you working towards your goals, we've put together some great material to keep you on top of what we've covered so you don't lose it! (Trust us when we say _it's not like riding a bike_.) Below is a list of _completely_ achievable assignments that we ask you to complete before the start of class on **Monday, January 4th, 2021**.

### Deliverables - IN PROCESS
The deliverable for _each_ assignment task will be listed under each assignment description as the **deliverable**. Please be sure to follow the isntructions on submission of these deliverables to aid the instructional team in reviewing your submissions upon return from winter break. Many thanks in advance!

## 4) Computer Science On myGA - (Edits still in process, awaiting myGA access to same materials)


```
General Assembly has put together _great_ reference material for Computer Science concepts which is available on your [my.generalassemb.ly](https://my.generalassemb.ly/) account.  It includes modules for: 

- Algorithms
- Data Structures
- Design Patterns

ðŸ‘‡ This will _definitely_ change!
Being that you have already been introduced to Link Lists and Stacks/Queues, we'd ask that you watch the entire Data Structures videos series (4.5hrs | 9 lessons).
