# General Assembly is out for winter break! 

Although General Assembly is out for winter break, it's _best_ y'all keep up those cool new skills you're developing!

Below is a list of _completely_ achievable assignments that we ask you to complete _before_ the start of class on **Monday, January 4th, 2021**.

### Deliverables
The deliverable for _each_ assignment task will be listed under each assignment description as the **deliverable**. Please be sure to follow the isntructions on submission of these deliverables to aid the instructional team in reviewing your submissions upon return from winter break. Many thanks in advance!

Issue tickets will be used when submitting:
- links to a separate repository
- screenshots
- adding a file to your **forked** `holiday-break-hw` repo
3. Screenshots
In order to take a screenshot you need to use one of the following keystrokes:
- `command + shift + 3` to capture **all** active screens (this includes any connected monitors).
- `command + shift + 4` to "draw" a box around what you want to capture (this will _only_ capture what is within the box).
- `command + shift + 5` to select only the active _window_ you want to capture.
4. Completed prompt documents
- Answer any provided prompt documents and submit a link to the completed document.
